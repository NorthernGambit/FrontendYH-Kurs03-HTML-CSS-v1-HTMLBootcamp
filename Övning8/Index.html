		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			Book One of the Stormlight Archive, begins an incredible new saga of
			epic proportion.Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny
			tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so
			frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike.
			Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts
			into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography
			offers shelter.It has been centuries since the fall of the ten
			consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their
			Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of
			armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men
			trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won
			by them.One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the
			Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical
			apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been
			reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies
			fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men
			and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.Brightlord
			Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother,
			the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The Way of
			Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the
			Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.Across the
			ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an
			eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece, Jasnah.
			Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are less than
			pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at
			secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.The
			result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building,
			The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight
			Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.Speak again the ancient
			oaths:Life before death.Strength before weakness.Journey before
			Destination.and return to men the Shards they once bore.The Knights
			Radiant must stand again.
